;; # Advent of Code 2018 - Day 15
;; [puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/15)
;; For this day we essentially have to implement a game.
;; You can see the original page for all of the details, but the
;; short version is that there a board with goblins and elves on it,
;; and each turn, one a time the units move towards one another and then
;; start attacking.  The last species standing wins.


;; ## Data processing
;; The first thing we'll do is load in the raw input file.
(def data-string (slurp "../input/15.txt"))

;; We'll save some constants from the problem description for our
;; default attack strength and hp.
(def ATTACK 3)
(def HP 200)

;; We'll represent the state of the game with a large map, with a `walls` key
;; set to a set of locations that have walls, and then a `goblins` and `elves` map
;; mapping locations to the health of the creature at that location.
;; Finally we'll store the `round` that we are on, as well as the `goblin` and `elf` attack power (for use later.)
