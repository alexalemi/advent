;; ## Logic
;; For the core puzzle today, we are tasked with starting in room `AA` and then every minute we can
;; move along a tunnel or we can open a valve.  The goal is to figure out
;; a strategy that will allow the greatest release in pressure.  Once a valve is opened
;; it stays open and we can continue.
;;
;; To track our state, we'll need to know where we are, the time, which valves are open and
;; how much pressure we have released so far.

(def init {:loc :AA :open #{} :released 0 :time 30})

;; Let's start by working out the neighboring states.

(defn neighbors [data state]
  (let [state (update state :time dec)
        {:keys [loc open time]} state
        info (data loc)]
    (when (>= time 0)
      (concat
         ;; We could move to any of the neighboring locations
       (for [neigh (:connections info)]
         (assoc state :loc neigh))
         ;; And if our own valve isn't open, we could open it
       (when (and (not (open loc)) (pos? (:flow info)))
         [(-> state
              (update :open conj loc)
              (update :released + (* time (:flow info))))])))))

;; Having worked out the neighbors from every state, at this point, naively we would
;; simply exhaust all possibilities, however even on the test problem
;; this doesn't run in any reasonable amount of time.
;;
;; We need to cut down the search space.  Let's reason things out a bit.  We need
;; some kind of rules to exclude considerating states that we know are going to lose.
;; One thing I think we know is that there isn't any reason to consider
;; a state at the same location with the same sets of open valves if they have the same
;; `:released` and simply less `:time`.  Similarly if they have the same `:time` but
;; simply has less `:released` its not worth considering.  Similarly, if we have the
;; same `:time` and `:released` but have more `:open` valves, that is also just worse and
;; not worth considering.
;;
;; Overall this seems to be a problem where I'm not sure we have a total ordering on the states
;; but we certainly have some kind of partial ordering or pareto frontier.  There are
;; states or sets of states that dominate over other states.  We should try to exclude the ones
;; that are dominated over.
;;
;; Let's see if we can limp into this by maintaining a set of all previously considered states
;; and then see if we can filter out those states that aren't worth considering.

;; So far this approach hasn't really yielded fruit for me.  It doesn't seem to be reducing the search space fast
;; enough to let me solve the real puzzle.
;;
;; At this point to make further progress, I think I need to try to do each clock cycle all at once and
;; only keep the dominating instances. I'm not sure if I could manage to keep only a single trial at each
;; location for each time stamp but it would be nice.
;;
;; So, for each location we'll consider only the best state possible for that step at that location.
